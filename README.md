This is a Java based Android Application focused on utilizing Web-API's in order to enhance our overall product.
<br>
It is currently designed to pick the "better" player out of two from the NBA, NFL and MLB, based on a few hand picked stats.
<br>
I used a sports API which provided me with data for specific players based on which player and which league he was in.
<br>
The Data class includes the API call method which provides the rest of the program a JSON to work with.
<br>
The MLB, NFL and NBA classes each have methods which parse the JSON and return specific stats used to compare players.
